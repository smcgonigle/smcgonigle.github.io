By installing, accessing, or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms in full. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App. We recommend that you review these Terms regularly, as we may modify them at any time and such changes will be effective upon posting within the App or on our website.</p>
            
            <p>This agreement governs your use of the App only. Our separate Privacy Policy governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information and is incorporated by reference for your information.</p>
      
            <h3>1. Definitions</h3>
            <p>For the purposes of these Terms, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:</p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>App:</strong> The “GPS Format Converter” software application developed and published by Bitwire Technologies available for download on authorized mobile platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>User/You:</strong> Any individual who downloads, installs, accesses, or uses the App.</li>

              </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>2. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
            <p>By downloading, installing, or using the App, you confirm that you are of legal age in your jurisdiction or have obtained parental or guardian consent where required. These Terms constitute a binding agreement between you and Bitwire Technologies. If you do not agree to these Terms in their entirety, you must not use the App.</p>
            <p>Continued use of the App after any modifications to the Terms constitutes acceptance of those changes. Please review these Terms periodically. It is your responsibility to ensure awareness of any updates.</p>
      
            <h3>3. Description of Services</h3>
            <p>The GPS Format Converter is a utility application that allows users to convert geographic coordinates between different commonly used formats (e.g., decimal degrees, degrees-minutes-seconds, and others). The App is available as a paid, one-time purchase through the Apple App Store, with no subscriptions or recurring payments required.</p>
            <p>No additional features requiring user registration, account creation, or interactive user content are provided. The App’s functionality is limited to the conversion of GPS coordinates and does not extend to navigation, live GPS tracking, or any location-based user profiling.</p>
    
            <h3>4. Payment and Refund Terms</h3><br>
            <h4>4.1. Paid Application</h4>
            <p>Access to the App is granted upon a one-time purchase via the Apple App Store. There is no subscription model or recurring fee. The payment amount is as displayed at the point of sale within the Apple App Store and may be subject to local taxes or currency conversions, which are handled by Apple.</p>
            <h4>4.2. Refunds</h4>
            <p>Refund requests and processing for purchases of the App are handled exclusively by Apple Inc., according to their <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/118223">official refund policy</a>. Bitwire Technologies does not directly accept or process refund requests. For any refund request, users must follow Apple’s procedures, which may require you to visit <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com/">reportaproblem.apple.com</a>, select your purchase, and submit a request outlining the reason for your refund.</p>
            <p>Refund approval is at Apple’s discretion; Bitwire Technologies neither controls nor guarantees outcomes. Users are advised to familiarize themselves with Apple’s refund process prior to purchase.</p>
            <h5>Key points regarding refunds:</h5>

                <li>Refund decisions, timelines, and outcomes are determined by Apple’s policies.</li>
                <li>Processing times depend on your payment method (usually 1–7 business days).</li>
                <li>Ineligible or excessive refund requests may be denied by Apple.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>19. Explanatory Paragraphs and Legal Compliance Rationale</h3><br>
            <h4>Legal Compliance with Saskatchewan and Canadian Law</h4>
            <p>Canadian businesses operating digital platforms must ensure their terms of service are not only clear and accessible but also comply with federal standards such as the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and relevant provincial law—in this case, Saskatchewan. Under Saskatchewan commercial practice, terms must provide clarity on liability, intellectual property, and dispute resolution, while offering transparent user rights and company responsibilities. Enforcement of online contracts in Canadian courts hinges on transparency, fairness, and whether clear evidence exists that users had reasonable notice and opportunity to accept the terms—typically via a clickwrap or similar mechanism.</p>
            <h4>Importance of Limitation of Liability and “As Is” Clauses</h4>
            <p>A robust “as is” clause is a legal best practice and limits exposure to consumer litigation by disavowing any express or implied warranty, which might otherwise be imposed by operation of law (such as implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for purpose). This is of particular importance for software distributed globally or to a general audience, as bugs, downtime, or misinterpretations of functionality can potentially have severe consequences if not disclaimed up front.</p>
            <h4>Intellectual Property Ownership</h4>
            <p>Explicitly stating that the company retains all rights in the app—including source code, branding, and output—prevents unauthorized replication and protects the investment in the product. Under Canadian law, the copyright in works developed by or for a company is generally retained by the employer or principal, unless otherwise specified; stating this in the TOS avoids disputes over ownership of code or design.</p>
            <h4>Privacy and Data Protection</h4>
            <p>Even when no user data is collected, including a clear statement to that effect reassures users and clarifies compliance with Canadian and international privacy regimes—particularly because app stores increasingly require privacy disclosures, and privacy expectations among global users are high. Reference to a privacy policy, even if it is confirmatory (in this case, showing that no data is collected), is standard across both major app platforms and is considered best legal practice.</p>
            <h4>Payment and Refund Policy</h4>
            <p>Delegating all payments and refund processing to Apple ensures transparency and compliance with Apple App Store requirements, while also removing the burden and liability for funds handling from the app developer. Notifying users of reliance on Apple’s established refund systems prevents confusion and improper refund requests—Apple’s system is uniform, and appeals or disputes are resolved according to their posted timeline and practices (usually 1–7 days for refunds to settle, depending on the payment method).</p>
            <h4>External Links Disclaimer</h4>
            <p>Including a tailored external links disclaimer protects the app provider from any liability relating to the content, operation, or outcomes of visiting external sites, which may change or become compromised without notice. This is especially critical as Canadian and global tort law is increasingly strict about platform liability for third-party content.</p>
            <h4>Terms Modifications and Notificatio</h4>
            <p>Stating that Terms may be updated at any time, with notice provided within the app or on the website, is a modern legal requirement and reflects industry practice. While Canadian law favors user notification and clear communication of material changes, regular App users are generally deemed to have constructive notice if updates are fairly displayed and readily available for review.</p>
            <h4>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h4>
            <p>Establishing local jurisdiction (here, Saskatchewan, Canada) for any dispute ensures predictability, offers consumer protection under a familiar regime, and prevents the unfairness of forum shopping or imposing foreign laws. This is essential for enforceability, especially with a global audience, and ensures compliance with the Canadian common law standard that contracts not be unfairly one-sided as to venue.</p>
