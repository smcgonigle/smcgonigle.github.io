        set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>


      <p>
        <h3>Disclaimer And Non-Waiver of Rights</h3>
      </p>

      <p>Windthrow Apps makes no guarantees, representations or warranties of any kind as regards the website and
        associated technology.
        Any purportedly applicable warranties, terms and conditions are excluded, to the fullest extent permitted by
        law. Your
        use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The
        Service is
        provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied
        warranties
        of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance, except as
        provided for
        under the laws of any province in Canada. In such cases, the provincial law shall apply to the extent
        necessary.</p>

      <p>Windthrow Apps its subsidiaries, affiliates, and its licensors do not warrant that a) the Service will
        function uninterrupted,
        secure or available at any particular time or location; b) any errors or defects will be corrected; c) the
        Service is free
        of viruses or other harmful components; or d) the results of using the Service will meet your requirements.</p>

      <p>If you breach any of these Terms and Windthrow Apps chooses not to immediately act, or chooses not to act at
        all, Windthrow
        Apps will still be entitled to all rights and remedies at any later date, or in any other situation, where you
        breach these
        Terms. Windthrow Apps does not waive any of its rights. Windthrow Apps shall not be responsible for any
        purported breach
        of these Terms caused by circumstances beyond its control. A person who is not a party to these Terms shall
        have no rights
        of enforcement.</p>

      <p>You may not assign, sub-license or otherwise transfer any of your rights under these Terms.</p>


      <p>
        <h3>Exclusions</h3>
      </p>

      <p>As set out, above, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or
        limitation of
        liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you. Provincial
        laws of Canada
        may apply to certain products and service provided.</p>


      <p>
        <h3>Governing Law</h3>

        and the laws of Canada, as applicable.</p>

      <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction,
        then any remaining
        provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us
        regarding our Service,
        and supersede and replace any prior agreements, oral or otherwise, regarding the Service.</p>


      <p>
        <h3>Changes</h3>
      </p>

      <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time.</p>

      <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by
        the revised terms.
